-Nested if in Java refers to having one if statement inside another if statement
-If the outer condition is true, the inner conditions are checked and executed accordingly
-Note:
*Normal if condition checks condition independently which means  each condition works on its own
*Whereas nested if checks conditions that depend on each other, which means one condition is only checked
if another condition is true

Syntax of Nested if
if(condition 1){
   if(condition 2){
     if(condition 3){
     //statements
     }
   }
 }
=If the outer condition satisfies then only the inner condition will be checked
//Along with if condition, else condition can be executed

Advantages
It provides a clear structure for handling multiple related conditions
-It ensures that inner conditions are evaluated only when necessary, improving efficiency

Disadvantages
-Overuse of this condition can lead to making code harder to read and maintain
-It may lead to increased complexity if not structured properly
