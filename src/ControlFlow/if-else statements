=The if-else statement in java is a powerful decision-making tool used to control the program flow
based on conditions
=It executes the one block of code  if a condition is true and another block if the
condition is false

Syntax of if else
if(condition){
  //Execute this block
  //if the condition is true
  }
 else {
   //Executes  this block if
   //condition is false
   }

Working of a if-else Statement
i)Control falls into the if block
ii)The flow jumps into the condition
iii)The condition is tested:
*If the condition yields true, go to step 4
*If the condition yields false, go to step 5
iv)The if block or the body inside the if is executed
v)If the condition is false, the else block is executed instead
vi)Control exits the if-else block

Nested if statement
-In Java, we can use nested if statement to create more complex conditional logic
//Nested if statements are if statements inside other if statements

public class NestedIf{
    public static void main(String[]args){
       int a = 25;
       double w = 65.5;

       if(a >= 18){
          if(w >= 50.0){
          System.out.println("You are eligible to donate blood");
          } else {
           System.out.println("You must weigh at least 50 kilograms to donate blood.");
           }
          } else {
          System.out.println("You must be at least 18 years to donate blood");
          }
       }
   }


//The first print statement is in a block of "if"  so the second statement is not in the block
of "if"
//The third print statement is in else but that else has no corresponding if
//That means an "else" statement cannot exist without an "if" statement
