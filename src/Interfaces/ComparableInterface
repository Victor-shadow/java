=The Comparable Interface in Java is used to  define the natural ordering of objects for a user-defined class.
=It is part of the java.lang package and it provides a compareTo() method to compare instances of the classes
=A class has to implement a ComparableInterface to define its natural ordering

=Declaration Of A comparable Interface
public interface Comparable<T>{
int compareTo(T obj);
}

where T is the type of object to be compared
=It compares the current object with the specified object
=It returns:
Negative: if currentObject < specifiedObject
Positive: if currentObject > specifiedObject
Zero: If currentObject == specifiedObject

Use of Comparable Interface
=The Comparable interface contains the method compareTo() to decide order of elements
=Override the compareTo() method in the pair class
=Create an array of Pairs and populate the array
=Use Arrays.sort() function to sort the array
