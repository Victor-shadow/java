-A wrapper class in Java is one whose Object wraps or contains primitive data types
-When we create an object in a wrapper class, it contains a field and this field, we can stor
primitive data types
-We ca wrap a primitive value into a wrapper object

Need of Wrapper classes
I)They convert primitive data types into objects. Objects are needed if we wish to modify the arguments passed into a method
(because primitive types are passed by value)
II)The classes in java.util.package handle only objects and hence wrapper classes are useful in these
cases
III)An object is needed to support synchronization in multithreading
IV)Data structures in the Collection framework, store only objects(reference types) and not primitive
types

Autoboxing
-The automatic conversion of primitive types to the object of their corresponding wrapper classes is known as
autoboxing
-int to Integer, long to Long, char to Character

Unboxing
-It is the reverse process of autoboxing. Automatically converting an object of a wrapper class
to its corresponding primitive types
Integer to int, Double to double, Character to char

Custom Wrapper Classes In Java
-Java wrapper classes wrap the primitive data types
-We can create a class that wraps data inside it

Advantages of Wrapper Classes
-Collections only allow object data
-On object data we can invoke multiple methods compareTo(), equals(), toString()
-The cloning process can only work on Objects
-Object data allow null values
-Serialization only allows object data
