=>final keyword is used to make a variable constant meaning the value of the variable cannot change throughout the program

//Final Arrays
If an array is final, it cannot be pointed to a new array but the elements inside the array can be modified
Example:
final int[]arr = {100, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70};
//Modification of elements inside the array works
arr[0] = 10;
//Reassignment of array reference triggers a compilation error
arr = new int[]{600, 700, 800}

NOTE:
= Elements in a final array can be modified since Array elements are mutable.
= Final arrays can not be reassigned to a new array since reference is final and cannot point to a new object
= Object states in a final array can be modified
=Object References stored cannot be reassigned since final variables cannot point to a new instance
= array variables are actually a reference to an object
