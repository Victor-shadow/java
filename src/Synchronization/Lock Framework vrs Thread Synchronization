-In Java, thread synchronization is achieved using the Lock Framework which is present in the
java.util.concurrent package
-Synchronization ensures that only one thread can access a resource at  a time by preventing issues like
data corruption or inconsistency
-Java offers two primary mechanisms to achieve synchronization
i)Lock framework
ii)synchronized block
-Both serve similar purposes and they offer different levels of flexibility and control
The lock framework provides a more sophisticated approach when dealing with multiple threads and
shared resources

Difference through Lock Framework and Thread Synchronization
Lock Framework                                                    Thread Synchronization
i)More Flexible. Allows multiple                                  Limited flexibility.Only one
locks for different methods                                       can be applied per method or class
ii)Allows higher concurrency by                                   Less concurrency due to locking
using different locks for                                         entire method or
different tasks                                                   class
iii)Provides explicit control                                     Implicit locking with no control over
over when to lock or unlock                                       exact limit
iv)The list of waiting threads                                    Not possible with
can be seen using Lock framework                                  synchronized
v)Offers better strategies to                                     Less control over
avoid deadlocks using try-lock                                    deadlock
mechanisms                                                        prevention
vi)Supports interruptible                                         Synchronized blocks are
acquisition(lock.tryLock())                                       non-interruptible

Lock Framework
-The Lock framework is primarily based on the Lock interface with Reentrant lock being the most commonly
used implementation
-The Lock framework allows explicit locking and unlocking of resources, providing greater control over thread access
It supports features such as non-blocking locking with tryLock()

Thread Synchronization
-It is the process of controlling the order of access to shared resources among multiple threads to prevent
data corruption and ensure correct program execution
In the present time we use Locks to achieve thread synchronization
