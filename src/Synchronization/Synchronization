-In multithreading, synchronization is important to make sure that multiple threads safely work
on shared resources
-Without synchronization, data can become inconsistent or corrupted if multiple threads access
and modify shared variables at the same time
In Java, it is a mechanism that ensures that only one thread, can access a resource at a given time
This helps to prevent issues such as data inconsistency and race conditions when multiple threads
interact with shared resources

Need For Synchronization
-When multiple threads share resources, synchronization makes sure that only one thread accesses the resource
at a time.
-This prevents problems like data getting mixed up or broken because of multiple threads changing it together

Synchronized block
-Java provides a way to create threads and synchronize their tasks using synchronized block

-A synchronized block in Java is synchronized on some object
-Synchronized blocks in Java are marked using the synchronized keyword
-All synchronized blocks synchronize on the same object and can have only one thread executed inside them
one at a time. All the other threads attempting to enter the synchronized block are blocked until  the thread inside
the synchronized block exits the block

General form of a Synchronized Block
synchronized(sync_object){
//access shared variables and other shared resources
}
This synchronization is implemented in Java with a concept called monitors or locks
-Only one thread can own a monitor at a given time. When a thread acquires a lock, it is said to have entered the
monitor. All the other threads attempting to enter the locked monitor will be suspended until
the first thread exits the monitor

Types of Synchronization
i)Process Synchronization
ii)Thread Synchronization


Process Synchronization
-It is a technique used to coordinate the execution of multiple processes
-It ensures that the shared resources are safe and in order

Thread Synchronization
-Thread Synchronization is used to coordinate and ordering of the execution of the threads in a
multi-threaded program
-There are two types of thread synchronization
i)Mutual Exclusive
ii)Cooperation(Inter-thread communication)

MutualExclusion
-It helps to keep the threads from interfering with one another while sharing data
-There are types of Mutual Exclusive mentioned:
i)Synchronized method
ii)Synchronized block
iii)Static synchronization
