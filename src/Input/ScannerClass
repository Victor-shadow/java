=In Java, the scanner class is present in the java.util.package and it is used to obtain
input for primitive types like int, double etc and strings
=The scanner class can be used to read input from a user or a file

To Use Scanner Class to take User Input
1)import the java.util.Scanner package in the top of the program file. Without importing the package, the Scanner class
cannot be used
We can also import the java.util.* package to use all the classes present in the package

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[]args){

     }

2)Create the object of the scanner class
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
"sc" is an object of the Scanner class
Using the object we can use various methods of the Scanner class

3)Create the variable and using Scanner class object invoke the corresponding method to take input value
int variable = sc.nextInt();

Java Scanner Input Types
=The scanner class helps take the standard input stream in java.
Method                                               Description
nextBoolean()                                        used for reading boolean values
nextInt()                                            used for reading int values
nextFloat()                                          used for reading Float values
nextDouble()                                         used for reading Double values
nextByte()                                           used for reading Byte values
nextLine()                                           used for reading Line values
nextLong()                                           used for reading Long values
nextShort()                                          used for reading short values
hasNextInt()                                         used to check if the token is an integer
hasNextLine()                                        Checks if there is input in the next line
useDelimiter()                                       Changes the default whitespace delimiter

Note:
i)To create an object of Scanner class, pass the predefined object System.in which represents the standard
input stream.We may pass an object of class file if one wants to read input from a file.
ii)To read numerical values from a certain data type XYZ the function to use is nextXYZ()
iii)To read strings use nextLine()
iv)To read a single character, use next().charAt(0). next() function returns the next token/word in the input as a string
and charAt(0) function returns the first character in the String
v)Always close the scanner object to avoid resource leaks
vi)The scanner class reads an entire line and divides the line into tokens.
Tokens are small elements that have meaning to the Java compiler

Scanner Methods
I) nextBoolean method()
=The nextBoolean() method of java.util.Scanner scans the next token of the input as a Boolean
=If translation is successful, the scanner advances past the input that matched

public boolean nextBoolean(){
    }

Parameters: The function does not accept any parameter
Return Value: The function returns the boolean value scanned from the input
Exceptions: the function throws three exceptions:
InputMismatchException: if the next token is not a valid Boolean
NoSuchElementException: throws if input is exhausted
IllegalStateException: throws if this scanner is closed


II)nextByte method
-The nextByte(radix) method of java.util.Scanner class scans the next token of the input as a Byte
=If the translation is successful, the scanner advances past the input that matched
=If parameter radix is not passed then it behaves similarly as nextByte(radix) where radix is by default

Syntax:
public byte nextByte()

Parameters: The function accepts parameter as radix which is used to interpret the token as a Byte value
Return Value: This function returns the byte scanned from the input
The function throws three Exceptions as follows:
InputMismatchException: if the next token does not match The Byte regular expression or is out of range
NoSuchElementException: throws if input is exhausted
IllegalStateException: throws if this scanner is closed


III)nextFloat method
=It scans the next token of the input as a Float().
=If translation is successful, the scanner advances past the input that matched.

Syntax:
public float nextFloat()
Parameters: The function does not accept any parameter
Return Value: The function returns the float value scanned from the input
Exceptions: The function throws three exceptions:
NoSuchElementException: If input is exhausted
IllegalStateException: if this scanner is closed
InputMismatchException:If the next token does not match the Float regular expression, or is out of range


IV)nextInt() method
=The nextInt(radix) method of java.util.Scanner class scans the next token of the input as int
If the translation is successful, the scanner advances past the input that matched.If the parameter radix is
not passed, then it behaves similarly as nextInt(radix) where radix is assumed to be a default one
Syntax: public int nextInt();
Parameters: The function accepts a parameter radix which is used to interpret the token as a int value
Return Value:This function returns the Int scanned from the input
Exception: The function throws the following exceptions:
InputMismatchException: If the nex token does not match the Integer regular expression, or is out of range
NoSuchElementException:throws if input is exhausted
IllegalStateException: throws if scanner is closed

V)nextLine() method
=The nextLine() method of java.util.Scanner class advances the scanner past the current line and returns the
input that was skipped. The function prints the rest of the current line, leaving out the line separator at the end
The next is set after the line separator. Since this method continues to search through the input looking
for a line separator, it may search for all the input searching for the line to skip  if no line separators are present

Syntax:
public String nextLine();

Parameters: The function does not accept any parameters
Return value: This method returns the line that was skipped
Exceptions: The function throws two exceptions as follows:
NoSuchElementException: throws if no line was found
IllegalStateException: throws if this scanner was closed


VI)nextLong() method
=The nextLong(radix) method of java.util.Scanner class scans the next token of the input as a long
If the translation is successful, the scanner advances past the input that matched.
If the parameter radix is not passed, then it behaves similarly as nextLong(radix) where the radix is assumed
to be default
=Syntax: public long nextLong()

Parameters:The function accepts a parameter radix which is used to interpret the token as a long value
Return value: This function returns the long scanned from the input
Exceptions:The function throws three exceptions as follows:
i)InputMismatchException: If the next token does not match the integer regular expression or is out of range
ii)NoSuchElementException: throws if input is exhausted
iii)IllegalStateException: throws if scanner is closed

VII)nextShort() method
=The nextShort() radix method of java.util.Scanner class scans the next token of the input as a short.
If the translation is successful, the scanner advances past the input that matched. If the parameter radix is not passed,
then it behaves similarly as nextShort(radix) where radix is assumed to be default
Syntax:
public short nextShort();

Parameters: The function accepts a parameter radix which is used to interpret the token as a short value
Return value: The function returns the short scanned from the input
Exceptions: The function throws the following exceptions:
i)InputMismatchException: If the next token does not match the integer regular expression, or is out of range
ii)NoSuchElementException: throws if input is exhausted
iii)IllegalStateException: Throws if scanner is closed
