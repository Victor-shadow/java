//Java being Object Oriented works in multi-threaded environments in which the thread scheduler assigns the processor to a thread based on the priority of the thread
//Whenever a thread is created in Java, it always has a priority assigned to it
//Priority can either be given by the Java Virtual machine while creating the thread or it can be given by the programmer explicitly


//Priorities in Threads
//It is where each thread has a priority
//every object has a priority which is represented by numbers ranging from 1 - 10

CONSTANT                                                        Priority
public static int NORM_PRIORITY                                 Sets the default priority for the thread(Priority:5)
public static int MIN_PRIORITY                                  Sets the minimum priority for the thread(Priority:1)
public static int MAX_PRIORITY                                  Sets the maximum priority for the thread(Priority:10)

public final int getPriority():java.lang.Thread.getPriority() method returns the priority of
the given thread
public final void setPriority(int newPriority): java.lang.Thread.setPriority() = method changes the priority of the thread to the value of the new priority
This method throws IllegalArgumentException if the value of the parameter newPriority goes beyond the minimum(1) and maximum(10) limit
