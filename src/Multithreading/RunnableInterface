=java.lang.Runnable is an interface that it is to be implemented by a class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread
=There are two ways to start a new Thread:
:Thread Class
:Runnable Interface(implement this interface)
=There is no need to subclass a Thread when a task can be done by overriding only the run() method of Runnable

Steps to Create a New Thread Using Runnable
1)Create a Runnable Implementer and implement the run() method
2)Instantiate the Thread Class and pass the implementer to the Thread, Thread has a constructor
which accepts Runnable Interface
3)Invoke start() of thread instance , start internally and calls the run() method of the implementer
:Invoking start() creates a new thread that executes a block of code written in the run() method
:Calling run() directly does not create and start a new Thread, it will run on the same thread
:To start a new line of execution, call start() on the thread
