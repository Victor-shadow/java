=In multithreading synchronization is important to make sure that multiple threads work safely
on shared resources
=Without synchronization data can become inconsistent and corrupted if multiple threads access and modify shared variables at the same time
=In Java it is a mechanism that ensures that only one thread can access a resource at any given time
=This process helps prevent issues such as data inconsistency and race conditions when multiple threads interact with shared resources

Need of Synchronization
=When multiple threads share resources, synchronization makes sure that only one thread accesses the resource
at a time

Synchronized Blocks in Java
=Java provides a way to create threads and synchronize their tasks using synchronized blocks
=A synchronized block in Java is synchronized on some object
=Synchronized blocks are marked with the synchronized keyword in java
=All Synchronized blocks synchronize on the same object and can only have one thread executed inside them at a time
=All the threads attempting to enter the synchronized block are blocked until the thread inside the synchronized block exits

General form of a Synchronized block
synchronized(sync_object)
{
//Access shared variables and other shared resources
}

//This synchronization is implemented in Java with a concept called monitors or locks
Only one thread can own a monitor at a given time
When a thread acquires a lock it is said to have entered the monitor
All other threads attempting to enter the monitor  will be suspended until the first thread exits the monitor


TYPES OF SYNCHRONIZATION
1: Process Synchronization
=It is a technique used to coordinate the execution of multiple processes
=It ensures that the shared resources are safe and in order

2:Thread Synchronization
It is used to coordinate and ordering of the execution of the threads in multi-threaded program
Types of thread synchronization
i Mutual Exclusive
ii Inter-thread Communication

Mutual Exclusion helps keep the threads from interfering with one another while sharing data
Types of Mutual exclusive
i: Static Synchronization
ii: Synchronized Block
iii: Synchronized method
