=Java provides in-built support for multithreaded programming.
=A multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently
Each part of such a program is called a thread, and each thread defines a separate path of execution
=When a java program starts up, one thread begins running immediately
This is usually called the main thread of the program because it is the one that gets executed when the program begins
=There are certain properties associated with the main thread:
=It is the thread from which other "child" threads will be spawned
=Often, it must be the last thread to finish execution because it performs various shutdown actions

HOW TO CONTROL MAIN THREAD
=The main thread is created automatically when the program starts
=To control it we must obtain a reference for it
=This can be done by calling the method currentThread() which is present in the thread class
=This method returns a reference to the thread on which it is called
=The default priority of the main thread is 5 and for all remaining user threads priority will
be inherited from parent to child

=The main() thread first verifies the existence of the main() method, and then it initializes the class
=For each program, a main thread is created by the Java Virtual Machine
