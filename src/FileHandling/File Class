-Java file class is a representation of a file or a directory pathname.
-A simple string is not adequate to name files since files and directory names have different formats
on different platforms
-Java File class contains several methods for working with the pathname, deleting and renaming files, creating new directories
listing the contents of the directory and determining several common attributes of files and directories

Features
1:It is an abstract representation of file and directory pathname.
2:A pathname, whether abstract or in string form can be either absolute or relative. The parent of the
abstract pathname may be obtained by invoking the getParent() method of this class
3:First of all, we should create the File class Object by passing the filename or directory name to it.
A file system may implement restrictions to certain operations on the actual file-system object, such as
reading writing and executing.These restrictions are collectively known as access permissions
4:Instances of the file class are immutable, that is once created, the abstract pathname represented by the File Object will never
change

CREATE A FILE OBJECT
=A file object is created by passing in a string that represents the name of a file, a String or another file object
i.e File a = new File("usr/local/bin/example");
//This defines an abstract file name for the example file in the directory /usr/local/bin
//This is an absolute abstract file name

Fields in File class
pathSeparator(String) = the character or string used to separate individual paths in a list of file system paths
pathSeparator(Char) = the character used to separate individual paths in a list of file system paths
separator(String) = default name separator character represented as a string
separator(Char) = default name separator character

Constructors of Java File Class
=File(File parent, String Child) = creates a new file instance from a parent abstract pathname
and a child pathname string
=File(String pathname) = creates a new File Instance by converting the given pathname string into an abstract pathname
=File(String parent, String Child) = creates a new File Instance from a parent pathname string and a child pathname string
=File(URI uri) = Creates a new File Instance by converting the given file:URI into an abstract pathname
