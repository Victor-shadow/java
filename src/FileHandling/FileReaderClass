=FileReader in java is a class in the java.io package which can be used to read a stream of characters from the files
=Java IOFileReader class uses either specific charset or the platform default charset for decoding
from bytes to characters

1: Charset = The Charset class is used to define methods for producing encoders and decoders and for recovering
several names combined with the charset
2: Default charset = The default charset is defined during implicit computer start-up and it depends on the locale
and charset of the underlying operating systems

Constructors of java FileReaderClass
Constructor                                       Description
FileReader(File file)                             Creates a new FileReader with the given File
                                                  to read(using default charset)
FileReader(FileDescriptor id)                     Creates a new FileReader with the given
                                                  FileDescriptor to read(default charset)
FileReader(File file, Charset charset)            Creates a new FileReader with a given file
                                                  to read(usually the given charset)
FileReader(String filename)                       Creates a new FileReader with a given FileName
                                                  to read(default charset)
FileReader(String filename, Charset charset)      Creates a new FileReader with given file to read
                                                  (usually the given charset)


METHODS OF JAVA FILE READER CLASS
I)read() = The read() method reads and passes a single character or -1 if the stream is ended
II)read(char[]charBuffer, int offset, int length) =It reads a stream of characters and stores them in the given Character Buffer
Offset is the position at which it starts reading and Length is the total number of characters to be read
It passes plenty of characters read or -1 if the stream is ended
III)ready() = It tells whether the stream is ready to be read.
A stream is said to be ready if its input buffer is not empty or blank
IV)getEncoding() = The getEncoding() is used to return the Title of the character encoding which is
being used by the stream
V)close() = it closes the stream and releases the system resources being associated with it
