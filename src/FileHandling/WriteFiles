=FileWriter class in java is used to write character-oriented data to a file as this class is character-oriented
because it is used in file handling in java
=There are many classes and methods used to write into a file in Java:
I)writeString() method
II)FileWriter class
III)BufferedWriter class
IV)FileOutputStreamClass

writeString()method
=This method can take four parameters
=These are file path, character sequence, charset and options
=The first two parameters are mandatory for this method to write into a file
=It writes the characters as content of the file
=It returns the file path and throws four exceptions
:It is better to use when the content of the file is short

FileWriter class
=If the content of the file is short, then using FileWriter class to write in the file is another better option
=It also writes the stream of characters as the contents of the file like writeString() method
=The constructor of this class defines the default character encoding and the default
buffer size in bytes

BufferedWriter class
It is used to write text to a character-output stream
=It has a default buffer size, but a larger buffer size can be assigned
=It is useful for writing characters, strings and arrays
=It is better to wrap this class with any writer class for writing data into a file if no prompt output is required


FileOutputStream Class
=It is used to write raw stream data into a file
FileWriter and BufferedWriter classes are used to write only the text to a file, but the binary data
can be written by using the FileOutputStream class
