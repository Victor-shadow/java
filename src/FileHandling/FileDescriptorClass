=java.io.FileDescriptor class in Java works for opening a file having a specific name
=If there is any content present in that file it will first erase all that content and put "Beginning of process" as the first line
=Instances of FileDescriptor class serve as an opaque handle to the machine-specific structure representing an open file
an open socket, or another source or sink of bytes
:The main practical use for a file descriptor class is to create a FileInputStream or FileOutputStream to
contain it
:Applications should not create their own file descriptors

There are three major fields in this class
i)err: A handle to the standard error stream
ii)in: A handle to the standard input stream
iii)out: A handle to the standard output stream


Declaration of FileDescriptor
public final class FileDescriptor extends Object
constructor = FileDescriptor(): creates a FileDescriptor object

Methods Associated with FileDescriptor
1)sync() method
java.io.File.sync() = synchronizes all the buffers with the underlying device
When all the modified data of the FileDescriptor have been written to the underlying device, the method returns
Syntax:
public void sync()
Return: void
Exception: SyncFailedException = This exception is thrown if there is no guarantee of synchronization
of buffers with the device

2)valid() method
java.io.File.valid() checks  whether the FileDescriptor object is valid or not
Syntax
public boolean valid()
Return true if the FileDescriptor object is valid else false
