=Java FileWriter class of the java.io package is used to write data in character form to a file
The FileWriter class in Java, is used to write character oriented data to a file
It is a character-oriented class that is used for file handling in Java
:This class inherits from OutputStreamWriter class which in turn inherits from the Writer class
:The Constructors of this class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are acceptable
To specify values, construct an OutputStreamWriter on a FileOutputStream
:FileWriter is meant for writing Streams of characters. For writing streams of raw bytes, consider using
FileOutputStream
:FileWriter creates the output file if it is present already

=FileWriter extends OutputStreamWriter and Writer classes
=It implements the following interfaces:
1)Closeable
2)Flushable
3)Appendable
4)AutoClosable

FileWriter Class Declaration
=public class FileWriter extends OutputStreamWriter

Constructors of FileWriter class
1)FileWriter(File file) = It constructs a FileWriter object given a File object. It throws an IOException
if the file exists but it is a directory rather than a regular file that does not exist but cannot be created
or cannot be opened for any other reason
2)FileWriter(File file, boolean append) = It constructs a FileWriter object given a File Object.If the second argument is true
then the bytes will be written to the end of the file, rather than the beginning. It throws an IOException, if the file exists
but is a directory rather than a regular file or does not exist but cannot be created, cannot be opened for any other reason
3)FileWriter(FileDescriptor fd) = it constructs a FileWriter Object associated with a FileDescriptor
4)FileWriter(File file, Charset charset) = it constructs the FileWriter Object when file and charset are given
5)FileWriter(File file, Charset charset, boolean append)  = It constructs the fileWriter when file and charset are given,
and a boolean indicating whether to append the data written or not
6)FileWriter(String fileName) = It constructs the fileWriter object given the file name
7)FileWriter(String fileName,Boolean append) = it constructs a FileWriter Object given a file name with a Boolean indicating
whether or not to append the data written
8)FileWriter(String fileName, Charset charset) = It constructs a FileWriter when a file name and charset are given
9)FileWriter(String fileName, Charset charset, boolean append) = It constructs a FileWriter when a filename and a charset is given and
and a boolean variable indicates whether to append data or not

METHODS OF FILE WRITER CLASS
Method                                                         Description
void write(int a)                                              writes a single character specified
                                                               by an integer value
void write(String text)                                        Write the string into FileWriter
void write(char c)                                             Write the char into FileWriter
void write(char[]c)                                            Write the char array into FileWriter
void write(String str, int pos,                                Writes a portion of a string from position pos
int length)                                                    until the length number of characters
void write(char ch[],int pos,                                  Writes the position of characters from array ch[]
int length)                                                    from position pos till length number of characters
void flush()                                                   Flushes the data of FileWriter
void close()                                                   Closes the file Writer
int getEncoding()                                              Returns the character encoding used by FileWriter

METHODS OF WRITER CLASS
append(char c) = Appends the specified character to this writer
append(char Sequence csq) = Appends the specified character sequence to this writer
append(char Sequence csq, int start, int end) = Appends a subsequence of the specified character sequence to the writer
close() = Closes the stream, flushing it first
nullWriter() = Returns a new Writer which discards all characters
write(char[]cbuf) = Writes an array of characters
write(String str) = Writes a String

OVERWRITING & APPENDING THE FILE
Overwriting a file: When creating a java FileWriter, we can decide whether to append the file to an existing file, or to overwrite any
existing file
This can be done by choosing the appropriate constructor
The constructor for overwriting any existing file takes only one parameter that is a file name

Writer fileWriter = new FileWriter(pathname);

Appending to a file: The constructor for appending a file or overwriting the file takes two parameters, the file name
and a boolean variable which decides whether to append or overwrite the file

Writer fileWriter = new FileWriter(pathname , true)//appends to a file
Writer fileWriter = new FileWriter(pathname, false)//overwrites the file

Appending data to a file
import java.io.*;
class AppendingFile{
  public static void main(String[]args){
    //Appending data in the file
    try(FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(fileName, true)){
    //true for append mode
    writer.write("\nAppend this line to the file");
    System.out.println("Data Appended to the file successfully");
    }
    catch(IOException e){
    System.out.println("An error occurred while appending" + " to the file: " + e.getMessage());
    }
  }
}

FILE WRITER & FILEOUTPUTSTREAM
=FileWriter writes a stream of characters while FileOutputStream is meant for writing streams in
raw bytes
=FileWriter deals with the character of 16 bits while on the other hand, FileOutputStream deals with 8-bit bytes
=FileWriter handles Unicode strings while FileOutputStream writes bytes to a file and it does not accept any characters or strings
and therefore for accepting strings it needs to be wrapped up with an OutputStreamWriter. string
