=In Java exception is an issue(run-time) error that occurs during the execution of a program
=When an exception occurs, the program terminates abruptly and the code beyond the exception never gets executed
Java provides the facility to create our own exceptions by extending the Exception class
Creating our own Exception is known as a CustomException in java or a user-defined exception in Java
A User-Defined Custom exception or custom exception is creating one's exception class and throwing that exception
using "throw" keyword

Java Custom Exception
A custom exception in Java is an exception defined by the user to handle specific application requirements
-These exceptions extend either the Exception class(for checked Exceptions) or the RuntimeException class
for unchecked Exceptions

We use Java custom exception,
i)To represent application specific errors
ii)To add clear, descriptive error messages for better debugging
iii)To encapsulate business logic errors in a meaningful way

Types of Custom Exceptions
i)Checked Exceptions: It extends the Exception class and it must be declared in a throws clause
of the method signature
ii)Unchecked Exception: It extends the RuntimeException class

Create a User-Defined Custom Exception
1)Create a new class that extends Exception class(for checked Exceptions) and RuntimeExceptions(UncheckedException)
2)Provide constructors to initialize the exceptions with custom messages
3)Add methods that provide additional details about the exception(this is optional)
