-A sealed class is a technique that limits the number of classes that can inherit the given
classes
-This means that only the classes designated by the programmer can inherit from that particular class
thereby restricting access to it
When a class is declared sealed, the programmer must specify the list of classes that can inherit it

Steps to create a Sealed class
-Define the class that you want to make a seal
-Add the "sealed" keyword to the class and specify which classes are permitted to inherit  it using
the "permits" keyword
