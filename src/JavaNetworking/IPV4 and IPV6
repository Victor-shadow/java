-IPv4 and IPv6 are two system versions that give devices a unique address on the internet
known as the Internet Protocol
-IP is like a set of rules that help devices send and receive data online
Since the internet is made of billion connected devices , each one needs its own special
number an IP address to be found
-IPv4 is the older version and uses the 32-bit address which allows  for about 4 billion unique addresses
It was used to be enough but with the growth of the internet and smart devices(IoT) there was running out
of IPv4 addresses that's why IPv6 was created. It uses a 128 bit address, which means it can support trillions
upto trillions of unique addresses

IPv4
IPV4 or Internet Protocol version 4, is the original addressing system of the internet introduced in 1983
It uses a 32-bit address scheme, which theoretically allows for over 4 billion unique addresses
(2^32)
IPv4 addresses are typically displayed in decimal format, divided into four octets separated by dots
192.168..1.1
IPv4 Address Format is a 32-bit address that comprises binary digits separated by a dot

     10000000               00001011                00000011                00011111


                               128.11.3.31


Characteristics of IPv4
i)32-bit address length: Allows for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses
ii)Dot-decimal notation: IP addresses are written in a format of four decimal numbers separated by dots each
192.168.1.1
iii)Packet structure: Includes a header and a payload ; the header contains information essential for routing
and delivery
iv)Checksum fields: Uses checksums in the header for error-checker and header integrity
v)Fragmentation: Allows packets to be fragmented at routers along the route if the packet
size exceeds the maximum transmission unit(MTU)
vi)Address Resolution Protocol: Used for mapping IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used
by data link protocol
vii)Manual and DHCP configuration: Supports both manual configuration of IP addresses and dynamic configuration
through DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
viii)Limited Address space: The main limitation which has led to the development of many IPv6 to cater
to more devices
ix)Network Address Translation: Used to allow multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address
x)Security: Lacks inherent security features requiring additional protocols  such as IPSec for secure
communications

Limitations of IPv4
i)Limited Address Space: IPv4 has a limited number of addresses, which is not enough for the growing
number of devices connecting to the internet
ii)Complex configuration: IPv4 often requires manual configuration or DHCP to assign addresses
which can be time consuming and prone to errors
iii)Less Efficient Routing: The IPv4 header is more complex, which can slow data processing and routing
iv)Security Issues: IPv4 does not have in-built security features, making it more vulnerable to attacks
unless extra security measures are added
v)Limited Support For Quality Of Services: IPv4 has a limited capabilities for prioritizing
certain types of data which ca affect the performance of real time applications like Video Streaming and VoIP
vi)Fragmentation: IPv4 allows routers to fragment packets which ca lead to inefficiencies and increased
chances of data being lost or corrupt
vii)Broadcasting Overhead: IPv4 uses broadcasting to communicate  with multiple devices on a network
which can create unnecessary network traffics and reduce performance

IPv6
-It is a widely used version of the Internet Protocol today
-It is becoming more common especially in areas like mobile networks
IPv6 stands for Internet Protocol version 6, Its the newer and advanced version of IP, offering improvements in address space
efficiency and security
IPv6 addresses are written in eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colon

IPv6 address Format
It is a 128-bit IPAddress which is written in a group of 8 hexadecimal numbers  separated by a colon

ABCD:EF01:2345:6789:ABCD:B201:5482:DO23

Characteristics of IPv6
i)128-bit addressing: Uses a 128-bit address format, allowing for an almost unlimited number of unique
IP addresses
ii)Hexadecimal notation: IP addresses are written in eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons
i.e: 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334.
iii)Connectionless and Connection-Oriented Support: Supports both connectionless(UDP) and connection oriented(TCP)
communications
iv)No Broadcast: Does not use broadcasting; instead use multicast and anycast for efficient data
delivery
v)Simplified Header Format:Has a simple and more efficient packet header compared to IPv4, improving
processing speed
vi)Integrated Security(IPSec): Includes built-in support for IPSec to provide confidentiality
and authentication and data integrity
vii)Auto-Configuration: Supports stateless and stateful address configuration, including automatic address
management
viii)No need for NAT: Eliminates the need for Network Address Translation due to its vast address space
ix)Improve Routing Efficiency: Reduces routing table size and simplifies network structure
for faster data delivery
x)Support for new Versions:Designed to work better with modern internet  services like mobile IP, VoIP,IoT devices


Benefits of IPv6 over IPv4
i)Larger Address Space: IPv6 has a larger address space than IPv4, which is required for expanding The IPConnected
devices IPv6 has 128 bit Address rather and IPv4 has a 32-bit Address
ii)Improved Security:IPv6 has some improved security which is built with it. IPv6 offers security like
Data Authentication, Data Encryption e.tc Have an Internet Connection is more Secure
iii)Simplified Header Format: As compared to IPv4, IPv6 has a simpler and more effective header structure
which is more cost effective and also increases the speed of the Internet Connection
iv)Prioritize:IPv6 contains stronger and more reliable support for QoS features, which helps in increasing
traffic over website and increases audio and video quality on pages
v)Improved Support for Mobile Devices: IPv6 has increased and better support for Mobile devices
It helps in making quick connections over other Mobile devices and in a safer way than IPv4

Switching from IPv4 to IPv6:
*Dual Stacking: Devices that can use both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time. This way they can talk to networks
and devices using either version
*Tunneling: This method allows IPv6 users to send data through the IPv4 network to reach other IPv6 users
Network Address Translation(NAT): NAT helps devices using different versions of IP addresses(IPv4, IPv6) to communicate with each other
by translating the addresses so they understand each other
