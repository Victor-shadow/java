-In computer networks, communication between devices occurs using two types of services
connection-oriented and connectionless
-These services define how data is transferred between a source and destination
Connection-oriented services establish a dedicated connection before data transfer to enable reliability
In contrast, connectionless services do not establish a connection, sending data without acknowledgement
or error correction

Connection-Oriented Service
-Connection-oriented service involve setting up a dedicated path between the source  and destination before
data transfer begins
-These services ensure that data is delivered in the correct sequence without errors
-In a connection-oriented service , the Handshake method is used to establish the connection
between the sender and receiver
-Before data transmission starts, connection-oriented services create a dedicated communication
channel  between the sender and the recipient
-As the connection is kept open until all data is successfully transferred, this guarantees dependable
data delivery

Examples of Connection-Oriented Service
i)Transmission Control Protocol in the TCP/IP suite
ii)Telephone calls in traditional telecommunication system

Features of Connection-Oriented Service
i)Dedicated Connection: A logical or physical connection is established before data
transfer
ii)Reliable Transmission: Data is transmitted with error checking, acknowledgements or retransmissions in case
of errors
iii)Sequencing: Data packets arrive at the destination in the correct order
iv)Higher Overhead: Establishing and maintaining a connection involves additional overhead

Advantages of Connection-Oriented Services
i:Reliable Data Transfer: Ensures that all data reaches its destination without errors
ii:Data Sequencing: Packets are delivered in the correct order
iii:Error Connection: Mechanisms are in place to detect and correct errors during
transmission
iv:Guaranteed delivery: Retransmissions occurs if data is lost

Disadvantages of Connection-Oriented Services
i:Higher latency: Establishing a connection adds latency before  data transfer begins
ii:More Overhead: Requires more resources for maintaining the connection, acknowledgements
and retransmissions
iii: Less Efficient for Small transfers: For short messages, the overhead of connection setup can outweigh
the benefits

Connection-Less Service
-Connectionless services send data without establishing a dedicated connection between the sources
and destination
-Each data packet is treated independently, and there is no guarantee of delivery or sequencing
-Connectionless Services does not guarantee of reliability. In this Packets, do not follow the same path
to reach their destinations. Connectionless services, deliver individual data packets without  first making a connection
Since each packet, is sent separately, delivery, order and mistake correction cannot be guaranteed
As a result, the services is quicker but less dependable
User Datagram Protocol is frequently used for streaming where dependability is not important as speed

Connectionless Services
*User Datagram Protocol
*Postal Services(analogous to sending letters without confirmation of receipt)

Features of Connectionless Services
i)No Connection Setup: Data is sent directly  without establishing a prior connection
ii)Independent Packets: Each packet is treated individually and may take different routes
to the destination
iii)Faster Transmission: No time is spent establishing and tearing down a connection
iv)Unreliable: No acknowledgement, retransmission or error connection is performed

Advantages of Connectionless Services
1: Low Latency: Data is transmitted immediately without waiting for a connection to be
established
2: Efficient for small Transfers: Ideal for small, time-sensitive messages  like DNS
lookups or VoIp
3: Scalable: Suitable for systems with many simultaneous users, as no connection
needs to be maintained

Disadvantages of Connectionless Services
-Unreliable: Data packets may be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of order
-No Error Handling: No built-in mechanisms for retransmissions or error correction
-Unsuitable for Large Transfers" Not ideal for applications requiring reliable  and
ordered delivery
