-User Datagram Protocol(UDP) is a Transport Layer protocol. UDP is part of the Internet Protocol suite, referred to as
UDP/IP  suite
-Unlike TCP, it is an unreliable and connectionless protocol. So there is no need to establish a connection
before data transfer
The UDP helps to establish low-latency and low-tolerating connections over the network
-The UDP enables process-to-process communication

User Datagram Protocol
-User Datagram Protocol(UDP) is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol(IP) suite
-It is a communication protocol used across the internet  for time-sensitive transmissions
such as video playback or DNS lookups
-Unlike Transmission control Protocol, UDP is a connectionless and does not guarantee delivery
order or error checking, making it a lightweight and efficient option for certain types of data
transmission

UDP Header
-UDP header is an 8-byte fixed and simple header, while for TCP it may vary from 20bytes to 60bytes
The first 8 bytes, contain all necessary header information and the remaining part consists of data
-UDP port number fields are each 16bits long, therefore the range of port numbers if defined from 0 to 65535
port number 0 is reserved. Port numbers help to distinguish different user requests or processes

     UDPHeader                                      UDP Data
     Source port                                    Destination port
     Length                                         Checksum

i)Source port: It is a 2 Byte long field used to identify the port number of the source
ii)Destination port: It is a 2 Byte long field, used to identify the port of the destined packet
iii)Length: Length is the length of UDP including the header and the data. It is a 16-bits field
iv)Checksum: Checksum is 2 Bytes long field. It is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement
sum of the UDP header, the pseudo-header of information from the IP header, and the data, padded with
zero octets at the end(if necessary) to make a multiple of two octets

NOTE: Unlike TCP, the Checksum calculation is not mandatory in UDP. No error control or flow control
is provided by UDP. Hence UDP, depends on IP and ICMP for error reporting
Also UDP provides port numbers so that it can differentiate user requests

Applications of UDP
i)Used for simple request response communication when the size of data is less and hence there is lesser
concern about flow and error control
ii)It is a suitable protocol for multicasting as UDP supports packet switching
iii)UDP is used for some routing update protocols like RoutingInformationProtocol
RIP
iv)Normally used for real time applications which cannot tolerate uneven delays between sections
of a received message
v)Voice Over Internet Protocol services such as Skype, Whatsapp use UDP for real time voice communication
The delay in voice communication can be noticeable if packets are delayed due to
congestion control, so UDP is used to ensure fast and efficient data transmission
vi)Domain Name System: also uses UDP  for its query/response messages. DNS queries are typically small  and require a quick
response time, making UDP a suitable protocol for this application
vii)Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol: uses UDP to dynamically  assign IP addresses to devices on a network
DHCP messages  are typically small, and the delay caused by packet loss or retransmission is generally not
critical for the application
Following Implementations use UDP as a transport layer protocol
-Network Time Protocol
-Domain Name Service
-BOOTP, DHCP
-Network News Protocol
-Quote of the day protocol
-TFTP, RTSP, RIP

The application layer can do some task through UDP:
Trace Route
Record Route
Timestamp
UDP takes a datagram from a Network Layer  attaches its header and sends it to the user. So, it works fast

TCP                                                                          UDP
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol                                        UDP Is the Datagram oriented protocol
Connection oriented means that the                                           This is because there is no overhead for

TCP is reliable as it guarantees the                                         The delivery of data to the destination
delivery of data to the destination                                          cannot be guaranteed in a User Datagram

TCP provides extensive error-checking                                        UDP has the only basic data checking
mechanism. It is because it provides                                         mechanism using
flow control and acknowledgement of data                                     checksum

An acknowledgement segment is present                                        No acknowledgement segment is present

Sequencing of data is a feature of                                           There is no sequencing of data in UDP,

Advantages of UDP
i)Speed: UDP is faster than TCP because it does not have the overhead of establishing a connection and ensuring reliable
data delivery
ii)Lower latency: Since there is no connection establishment, there is lower latency and faster response
time
iii)Simplicity: UDP has a simpler protocol design than TCP, making it easier to implement and manage it
iv)Broadcast support: UDP supports broadcasting to multiple recipients, making it useful for applications such as
video streaming and online gaming
v)Smaller packet size: UDP uses smaller packet sizes than TCP which can reduce network congestion and improve overall
network performance
vi)User Datagram Protocol is more efficient in terms of latency and bandwidth

Disadvantages of UDP
i)No reliability: UDP does not guarantee delivery of packets  or order of delivery, which can lead to missing
or duplicate data
ii)No congestion control: UDP does not have congestion control, which means that it can send packets at a rate
that can cause network congestion
iii)Vulnerable to attacks: UDP is vulnerable to denial-of-services attack where an attacker can flood a network with UDP
packets overwhelming the network causing it to crash
iv)Limited Use cases: UDP is not suitable for applications that require reliable data delivery such as email or file transfers
and better suited for applications that ca tolerate some data loss, such as Streaming and online gaming

How is UDP used in DDos attacks
-A UDP flood attack is a type of Distributed Denial of Service attack where an attacker sends a large number of
User Datagram Protocol packets to a target port
UDP protocol: Unlike TCP, UDP is connectionless and does not require a handshake  before data transfer. When a UDP  packet arrives at a server
it checks the specified port for listening applications. If no app is found, the server sends an ICMP destination unreachable packet to the supposed sender
(usually a random bystander due to a spoofed IP address)

Attack Process:
i)The attacker sends UDP packets with a spoofed IP sender addresses to random ports  on the target system
ii)The server checks each incoming packet's port for a listening application
(usually not found due to random port selection)
iii)The server sends ICMP "destination unreachable" packets to the spoofed sender(random bystander)
iv)The attackers flood the victim with UDP data packets, overwhelming its resources

Mitigation: To protect against UDP flood attacks , monitoring network traffic for sudden spikes and implementing security measures
are crucial. Organizations often use specialized tools and services to detect  and mitigate such attacks effectively

UDP Pseudo Header
-The purpose of using the pseudo header is to verify that the UDP packet has reached its correct
destination
-The correct destination consists of a specific machine and a specific protocol port number  within that machine

                                    Source

                                    Destination address

           Zero                      Protocol                          UDP length

UDP Pseudo header details
-The UDP header  itself specifies only protocol port number thus to verify the destination  UDP
on the sending machine computes a checksum that covers the destination  IP address as well as the UDP
packet
-At the ultimate destination, UDP software verifies the checksum using the destination IP address
obtained from the header of the IP packet that carried the UDP message
-If the checksum agrees, then it must be true, that the packet has reached the intended destination as well as the correct protocol
port within that host

User Interface
-A user interface should allow the creation of new received ports , receive operations
on the received ports that return the data octets is an indication of source port and source address
and an operation that allows a datagram to be sent, specifying the data source and destination ports
and address to be sent

IP Interface
i)The UDP module must be able to determine  the source and the destination internet address  and the
protocol field from the internet header
ii)One possible UDP/IP interface would return the whole internet datagram including the entire internet
header in response to a received operation
iii)Such an interface would also allow an UDP to pass a full internet datagram complete with the header
to the IP to send. the IP would verify certain fields for consistency  and compute the internet header checksum
iv)The IP interface allows the UDP module to interact with the network layer of the protocol stack
which is responsible for routing  and delivering data across the network
v)The IP interface provides a mechanism for the UDP module to communicate with other hosts
on the network by providing access to the underlying IP protocol
vi)The IP interface can be used by the UDP module to send and receive data packets over the network
with the help of IP routing and addressing mechanisms
