-The TCP/IP model is a framework that is used to model the communication in a network
It is mainly a collection of network protocols and organization of these protocols in different
layers for modeling the network
*It has four layers, Application, Transport, Network/Internet and Network Access
*While the OSI layer has seven layers, the 4 layer TCP/IP Model is simpler and used in
current Internet and Networking Systems

Role of TCP/IP
-One of its main goals is to ensure that the data sent by the sender arrives safely and correctly
at the receiver's end
-To achieve this, data is broken down into smaller parts called packets before being sent
These packets travel separately and are reassembled in the correct order when they reach the destination
This helps to prevent errors and makes sure the message is complete and accurate


Layers of TCP/IP Model
i)Application Layer
-The Application layer is the top layer of the TCP/IP model and the one closest to the user
-This is where  all the apps that are used such as web browsers, email clients and file sharing tools
connect to the network
-It acts as a bridge between the software(Chrome, Whatsapp, Gmail) and lower layers of network that actually send and receive data
It supports different protocols like HTTP(for websites) FTP(file transfers) SMTP(for emails),
DNS(find website addresses)
It also manages things like data formatting so that both sender and receiver understand the data
encryption to keep data safe, and session management to keep track of ongoing sessions


ii)Transport Layer
-The transport layer is responsible for making sure that the data is sent reliably and in the correct order
between devices
-It checks the data that one sends  like a message, file, or video arrives safely and completely
-This layer uses two main protocols: TCP and UDP  depending on whether the communication needs to be reliable
or faster
-TCP is used when the data needs to be correct and complete; loading a webpage and downloading a file
It checks for errors and resends missing pieces to keep everything in order
On the other hand UDP, is faster but does not guarantee delivery useful for things like
live video or online games where speed matters more than perfect accuracy

iii)Internet Layer
-The Internet layer is used for finding the best path for data to travel across different networks
so it can reach the right destination
-It helps data packets to move from one network to another until they reach the correct device
-This layer uses the Internet Protocol(IP) to give every device a unique IP address which helps to
identify where data should go
-The main job of this layer is routing deciding the best way data should travel
It also takes care of packet forwarding (moving data from one point to  another)fragmentation(breaking  large data into smaller parts)


iv)Network Access Layer
-The Network Access Layer is the bottom layer of the TCP/IP model
-It deals with the actual physical connection between devices on the same local network like computers
connected by cables or communicating through wifi
-This layer makes sure that data can travel over hardware, such as wire,switches or wireless signals
-It also handles important tasks like using the MAC Address to indentify devices creating frames(the format used to send data over the physical link)
and checking for basic errors during transmission

                                      Sending Host                                           Receiving Host
i)Application Layer                   Creates Request                                        Performs Request

ii)Transport Layer                    TCP/UDP Segment                                        TCP/UDP Segment

iii)Internet Layer                    IP Datagram                                            IP Datagram

iv)Data Link Layer                    Frame                                                  Frame

When Sending Data(From Sender to Receiver)
Application Layer - Prepares user data using protocols like HTTP, FTP or SMTP
Transport Layer(TCP/UDP) - Breaks data into segments  and ensures reliable TCP or fast UDP delivery
Internet Layer(IP) - Adds IP addresses and decides the best route for each package
Link Layer(Network Access Layer) - Converts packets into frames and sends them over the physical network

When Receiving Data(At the Destination)
i)Link Layer: Receives bits from the network and rebuilds frames to pass to the next layer
ii)Internet Layer: Checks the IP address, removes the IP header and forwards data to the
transport layer
iii)Transport Layer: Reassembles segments, checks for errors, ensures data is complete
iv)Application Layer: Delivers the final data to the correct application(display the web page on the browser)

Why TCP/IP Is used over OSI Model
TCP/IP is used over OSI  model because it is simpler, practical and widely adapted for real world networking
and the internet

Physical Layer

i)TCP/IP has only 4 layers, compared to 7 in OSI,  making it easier to understand and implement  in
real systems

ii)TCP/IP was designed based on working protocols, while the OSI model is more of a theoretical framework

iii)TCP/IP adapts well to different hardware and networks and includes error handling, routing and
congestion control

iv)TCP/IP is open, free to use and not controlled by any single organization, helping it to gain
universal acceptance

v)The OSI model is great for education and design principles, but TCP/IP  is the one actually used in real
world networking

Advantages of TCP/IP Model
i)Interoperability: The TCP/IP model allows different types of computers and networks to communicate with
each other. promoting compatibility and cooperation among diverse systems
ii)Scalability: TCP/IP is highly scalable, making it suitable for both small and large networks
from local area networks(LAN) to wide area networks(WAN)  like the internet
iii)Standardization: It is based on open standards and protocols ensuring that different devices and
software can work together without compatibility issues
iv)Flexibility: This model supports various routing protocols, data types  and communication methods
making it adaptable to different networking needs
v)Reliability: TCP/IP includes error-checking and retransmission features that enable reliable data transfers
even over long distances and through various networking conditions

Disadvantages of TCP/IP Model
i)Security Concerns:TCP/IP was not originally designed with security in mind. While there are now many security protocols
available such as (SSL/TLS) they have been added on top of the basic TCP/IP Model which can lead to
vulnerabilities
ii)Inefficiency for small networks: For very small networks, the overhead and complexity of the TCP/IP
Model may be unnecessary and inefficient compared to simpler networking protocols
iii)Linked by Address Space: Although IPv6 addresses this issue, the older IPv4 system has a limited
address space, which can lead to issues while address exhaustion in larger
networks
iv)Data Overhead: TCP the transport protocol , includes a significant amount of overhead to ensure
reliable transmission
