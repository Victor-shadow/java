Static Method = It is part of the class and can be invoked without creating an object
Instance Method = It belongs to an object hence objects have be created to use the methods

Differences between the StaticMethods & Instance Methods
Features                      StaticMethod                           InstanceMethod
Definition                    Created using the Static keyword       Requires objects of its class to                                be invoked
                              and retrieved without creation         be invoked
                              of objects
Access                        Access only Static variables           Can access both static and
                              and methods                            instance members
this keyword                  Cannot use this keyword within         Can use this keyword to refer
                              static methods                         to current object
Override                      Does not support runtime               Supports Runtime Polymorphism
                              polymorphism
Memory Allocation             Stored in MethodArea                   Stored in Method Area (PermGen/Metaspace)
                              PermGen space in Java 7,
                              replaced by Metaspace in Java 8+

STATIC METHODS
= A Static method is created using the static keyword, it can be invoked without creating an object of the class referenced by the class name itself
or reference to the objects of that class

Memory Allocation of Static Methods
=Static methods belong to the class, not its objects and they are stored in the permanent generation space of the heap
=Their local variables and arguments are stored in the stack
=They can be called without creating an instance of the class:
ClassName.methodName(args)

NOTE:
i)Static methods are shared among all objects of the class
ii)They cannot be overridden as they use static binding at compile time
iii)If both superclass and subclass have static methods with the same name it is called Method Hiding where the subclass method hides the superclass method

General Syntax of Static methods
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Java program to demonstrate static methods

import java.io.*;

class ClassName {

    // Static method definition
    public static ReturnType methodName() {

        // Print message to show execution
        System.out.println(">>> This is a static method.");

        // Return a value if not void
        return Value;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Calling static method directly
        methodName();

        // Calling static method using class name
        ClassName.methodName();
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTANCE METHOD
=They are methods that require creation of objects to operate.
=To access an instance method, an object of the class where the method is written needs to be created

Memory Allocation of Instance Method
=Instance Methods are stored in the PermanentGenerationSpace of the heap memory and Meta Space for better efficiency
=Its parameters, local variables and return values are allocated on the stack
= They can be called within their class or from other classes based on access modifiers

NOTE:
Instance Methods belong to the object and not the class and require an object to be called
They are stored in one Memory location and identify their object through the this pointer
They can be overridden as they use dynamic binding at runtime
