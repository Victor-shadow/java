-Java writer class is an abstract class in the java.io.package
-It is designed for writing character streams. Writer class in java provides methods for writing
characters and strings
-Since it is an abstract class, we cannot create an instance of it directly. Instead we use one of its
concrete subclasses FileWriter, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter

Declaration of Writer Class
-public abstract class Writer extends Object implements Appendable, Closable, Flushable

Constructors of the Writer Class
-The Writer class in Java has two protected constructors that allow for the creation of character streams
with synchronization capabilities
i)protected Writer(): Creates a new character stream that can  itself synchronize on the writer
ii)protected Writer(Object obj): Creates a new character stream that can itself synchronize on the given object

Java Writer class Methods
i)write(int char)
-It writes a single character to the character stream
-Characters being written are contained in 16 lower bits of the 'char' integer value the rest of the
16 higher bits are ignored by this method
Syntax: public void write(int char)
Parameter - The integer value of the character to be written
Return value - This method does not return any value
Exception - Throws IOException if an I/O error occurs during writing

ii)write(String str)
-It writes a string to the character stream
-Syntax: public void write(String str)
-Parameter: String to be written to the character stream
-Return Type: This method does not return anything
-Exception: Throws IOException if an I/O error occurs during writing


iii)write(String str, int offset, int maxlen)
-It writes some parts of the string to the character stream
-Syntax: public void write(String str, int offset, int maxlen)
Parameter:
str: string to be written to the character stream
offset: start position of the String
maxlen: The maximum length upto which the string has to be written
Return type: This method does not return anything
Exception: Throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException if the offset or maxlen is invalid, IOException
if an I/O Error occurs

iv)write(char[]carray)
-It writes character array to the character stream
-Syntax: public void write(char[]carray)
Parameter: The character array  to be written in the character stream
Return type: This method does not return any value
Exception: Throws IOException if an I/O error occurs during writing

v)write(char[]carray, int offset, int maxlen)
-It writes some parts of the character array to the character stream
-Syntax: public abstract void write(char[]carray, int offset, int maxlen)
-Parameter: caaray: The character to be written to the character stream
offset: start position of the character array
maxlen: maximum no of the character of the carray has to be written
Return Type: The method does not return any value
Exception: Throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if the offset or maxlen is invalid, IOException
if an I/O error occurs

vi)close()
It closes the character stream, flushing it first
-Syntax: public abstract void close()
-Parameter: This method does not take any parameter
-Return type: This method does not return any value
-Exception: Throws IOException if an I/O error occurs during close

vii)flush()
-It flushes the Writer stream
-Flushing one stream invocation will flush all other buffer in chain
Syntax: public void flush()
Parameter: This method does not take any parameter
Return type: This method does not return any value
Exception: Throws IOException if any I/O error occurs while flushing

viii)append(char Sw)
-It appends a single character to the writer
-Syntax: public Writer append(char Sw)

Parameter: character to be appended
Return type: This method returns a writer
Exception: Throws IOException if I/O error occurs during appending

ix)append(CharSequence char_sq)
-It appends specified character sequence to the Writer
Syntax: public Writer append(CharSequence char_sq)
-Parameter: Character sequence to append
-Return type: This method returns a writer, if char sequence is null, then NULL appends to the Writer
-Exception: Throws NullPointerException if char_sq is null, and IOException if an I/O error occurs during
appending

x)append(CharSequence char_sq, int start, int end)
-It appends a specified part of a character sequence to a writer
Syntax: public Writer append(CharSequence char_sq, int start, int end)
Parameter:
char_sq: Character Sequence to append
start: start of the character in the Char sequence
end: end of the character in the Char sequence
Return type: This method does not return any value
Exception: Throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if the start or end values are invalid,
and IOException if an I/O error occurs
