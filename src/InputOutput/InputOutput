-Java provides various Streams with its I/O package that helps the user to perform
all the input-output operations
-These Streams supports all the types of objects, data-types, characters, files, e.t.c, to fully
execute the I/O Operations

Standard or Default Streams in Java
                               System.in

                               Program

System.out                                                         System.in

-System.in: This is the standard input stream(System.in) that is used to read characters from the keyboard
or any standard input device
-System.out: This is the standard output stream(System.out) that is used to produce the result of a program
on an output device

Java Print Functions
print() -This method in Java is used to display a text on the console
This text is passed as the parameter to this method in form of String.
This method prints the text on the console and the cursor remains at the end of the text at the
console
Syntax: System.out.print(parameter);

println() - This method in Java is always used to display a text on the console
-It prints a text on the console and the cursor moves to the start of the next line at the console
-The next printing takes place from the next line
Syntax: System.out.println(parameter);


printf() - It is similar to println() and print() but printf() takes multiple arguments
This is used to format the output in Java

System.err: It is used to display the error messages. It works similarly to System.out with print(), println(),
printf() methods

Types of Streams
-Depending on types of Operations, streams can be divided into two primary classes:
1. Input stream: These streams are used to read data that must be taken as an input from a source array
or file or any peripheral device
e.g FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream, ByteArrayInputStream

FileInputStream           ByteArrayInputStream               PipedInputStream                      ObjectInputStream

                          InputStream

DataInputStream           FilterInputStream                 BufferedInputStream

                          PushBackInputStream


2. Output stream: These streams are used to write data as outputs into an array or file or any output peripheral devices

FileOutputStream         ByteArrayOutputStream           PipedOutputStream            ObjectOutputStream

                         OutputStream

DataOutputStream         FilterOutputStream               BufferedOutputStream

                         PushBackOutputStream


Types of Streams Depending on the Types of File
-Depending on the types of file, Streams can be divided into two primary classes which can be further divided
into other classes

                                 Streams
ByteStream                                                         CharacterStream
-BufferedInputStream                                               -BufferedReader
-DataInputStream                                                   -FileReader
-FileInputStream                                                   -InputStreamReader
-InputStream                                                       -OutputStreamReader
-PrintStream                                                       -Reader
-BufferedOutputStream                                              -PrintWriter
-DataOutputStream                                                  -Writer
-FileOutputStream                                                  -BufferedWriter
-OutputStream                                                      -FileWriter

-Byte Stream
:This is used to process data byte by byte(8 bits).
Though it has many classes, the FileInputStream and the FileOutputStream are the most popular ones
-The FileInputStream is used to read from the source and the FileOutputStream is used to write to the
destination

i)BufferedInputStream - It is used for Buffered Input Stream
ii)DataInputStream - It contains methods for reading java standard datatypes
iii)FileInputStream - This is used to read from a file
iv)InputStream - This is an abstract class that describes stream input
v)PrintStream - This contains the most used print() and println() method
vi)BufferedOutputStream - This is used for Buffered Output Stream
vii)DataOutputStream - This contains methods for writing java standard datatypes
viii)FileOutputStream - This is used to write a file
ix)OutputStream - This is an abstract class that describes stream output

2.Character Stream
-In Java characters are stored using unicode conventions
Character streams automatically allow one to read/write data character by character
Though it has many classes, the FileReader and FileWriter are the most popular ones
-FileReader and FileWriter are character streams used to read from a source and write to the
destination respectively

i)BufferedReader - It is used to handle buffered input stream
ii)FileReader - This is an input stream that reads from a file
iii)InputStreamReader - The input stream is used to translate  byte to character
iv)OutputStreamReader - This output stream is used to translate character to byte
v)Reader - This is an abstract class that define character stream input
vi)PrintWriter - This contains the most used print() and println() method
vii)Writer - This is an abstract class that defines character stream output
viii)BufferedWriter - This is used to handle buffered output stream
ix)FileWriter - This is used to output stream that writes a file
