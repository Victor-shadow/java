-This reduces the number of direct writes to the underlying output streams, making the process
more faster and efficient

ii)BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream out, int size): Creates a buffered output  stream with the specified buffer size

Methods of BufferedOutputStream class
-write(int b): Writes the specified bytes to this buffered output stream
-flush():Forces any buffered output bytes to be written out
-write(byte [] b, int off, int len): Writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting  at offset off
