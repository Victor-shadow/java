-FileInputStream class in Java is useful for reading data from a file in the form of java
sequence of bytes
-FileInputStream  is meant for reading streams  of raw bytes such as image data
-For reading streams of characters, use FileReader

-Class Declaration of FileInputStream
->public class FileInputStream extends InputStream
NOTE: FileInputStream is a subclass of InputStream, which is used for reading bytes in a file

Constructors of FileInputStream class
1.FileInputStream(String name)
-Creates an input file stream to read from a file with the specified name
FileInputStream fi = new FileInputStream("input.txt");

2.FileInputStream(File file)
-Creates an input file stream to read from the specified File object
File f = new File("file.txt");
FileInputStream fi = new FileInputStream(f);

3.FileInputStream(FileDescriptor fdobj)
-Creates an input file stream to read from the specified file descriptor
FileDescriptor fd = FileDescriptor.in;
FileInputStream fi = new FileInputStream(fd);

Methods of Java FileInputStream
i)available() = Returns an estimate of the number of the remaining bytes that can be read(or skipped over) from this
input stream
ii)close() = Closes the file input stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream
iii)finalize() = Ensures that the close method of the file input stream is called when there are no more references
to it
iv)getChannel() = Returns the unique FileChannel object associated with the file input
stream
v)getFD() =Returns the FileDescriptor Object that represents the connection to the actual file in the file system
being used by this FileInputStream
vi)read() = Reads a byte of data from this input stream
vii)read(byte[]b) = Reads up to b.length bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes
viii)read(byte[] b, int off, int len) = Reads up to len bytes of data from this input stream into an array of
bytes
ix)skip() = Skips over and discards n bytes of data from the input stream


Steps to Read Data from the FileInputStream Class
Step 1: Attach file to FileInputStream
-This step enables us to read data from the file
:FileInputStream fi = new FileInputStream("file.txt");

Step 2: Use read() method to read data
-Use the read() method of FileInputStream to read bytes of data from the file
int ch = fileInputStream.read()

Step 3: Check for End of file
-When there is no more data available to read further, the read() method returns -1

Step 3 B: print The Data
-Convert the integer value returned by the read() into character (using (char)) and then
print it

System.out.print((char)ch);

Key Features of FileInputStream
-Byte Oriented Stream: It reads data in form of bytes
-Direct access: It directly reads the file contents from the disk without buffering
-Platform Independent: It can work on any operating system
