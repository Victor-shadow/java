-Java, do while loop is an Exit control loop
-Unlike for and while loop a do while loop checks for the condition after executing the
statements of the loop body

public class Main{
   public static void main(String[]args){
      int c = 1;
      //use do-while loop
      do{
        System.out.println("do while loop: " +c);
        c++;
        } while(c<=5) {
        }
    }

Syntax
do{
  //Loop body
  Update expression
  }

//condition check
while(test_expression);

-The test expression for the do while loop must return a boolean value, else we get a compile time
error

Components of a do-while loop
-Test Expression: In this expression, we have to test the conditions
If the condition evaluates to true, then we will execute the body of the loop and go to update
the expression
-Otherwise we will exit the while loop

i <= 10

Update Expression
-After executing the loop body, this expression increments/decrements the loop variable
by some value
i++;

Execution of a do while loop
-Control falls in the do-while loop
-The statements inside the body of the do while loop get executed
-Update takes place
-The flow jumps to the condition
-Condition is tested:
if the condition yields true, go to step 6
If the condition yields false, the flow goes outside the loop
-The flow goes back to step 2

Do while loop
class Main{
    public static void main(String[]args){
    //declare and initialize expression
    int c = 1;
    //do while loop
    do{
       //Body of the do-while loop
       //print Statement
       System.out.println("Java is a high object oriented programming language");

      //update expression
      c++;
      }
   //test expression
   while(c < 6);
 }
}

The program executes in the following manner:
1. Program starts
2. c is initialized with a value of 1
3.Execution enters the loop
"Java is a high object oriented programming language" gets printed for the first time
Update is done. Now c = 2
4. Condition is checked. 2 < 6 yields true
5. Execution enters the loop
"Java is a high object oriented programming language" gets printed for the second time
Update is done. Now c = 3
6. Condition is checked 3 < 6 Yields true
7. Execution enters the loop
"Java is a high object oriented programming language" gets printed for the third time
Update is done now c = 4
8. Condition is checked 4 < 6 yields true
9. Execution enters the loop
"Java is a high object oriented programming language" gets printed for the fourth time
Update is done now c = 5
10. Condition is checked 5 < 6 yields true
11 Execution enters the loop
"Java is a high object oriented programming language" gets printed for the fifth time
Update is done now c = 6
12. Condition is checked 6 < 6 yields false
13.The flow goes outside the loop

do while loop without {}
import java.io.*;
class Main{
   public static void main(String[]args){
      int c = 1;
      do
      //only single statement in a do  block
      System.out.println("do-while block");
      //this condition is false  so only the do block
      //executes
      while(c >= 3);
      }
  }
