-Java while loop, is a control flow statement used to execute the block of statements repeatedly  until the given condition
evaluates to false
-Once the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop  gets executed

Syntax of a while loop
while(test_expression){
   //statements
   update_expression
}

Note:If we don't provide the curly braces '{' and '}' after while(condition) then by default the while
statement will consider the immediate one statement to be inside its block

Parts of Java While Loops
Test expression: This condition is evaluated before each iteration. If it returns true, then the loop executes
otherwise the loop exits
i.e i<=5
Update Expression: After executing the loop body, this expression increments and decrements the loop variable by some value
i.e i++;

i)Control enters the while loop
ii)The condition is tested
iii)if true, execute the body of the loop
iv)If false, exit the loop
v)After executing the body, update the loop variable
vi)Repeat from step 2 until the condition is false

while loop
public class whileLoop{
   public static void main(String[]args){
        //initialize counter variable
          int c = 1;
          //while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5
          while(c <= 5){
            System.out.println(c);
            //increment the counter
            c++;
            }
    }
}
