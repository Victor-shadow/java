-Java for loop is a control statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a
given condition
-The for loop in Java  provides a efficient way to iterate over a range of values, execute code
multiple times, or traverse arrays or collections

//For loop
class Main{
    public static void main(String[]args){
         /for loop to print numbers  from 1 to 5
         for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
             System.out.println(" " + i);
             }
           System.out.println("The loop has ended");
           }
        }

i)The program starts
ii)The for loop initializes i  to 1
iii)Condition i<= 5 is checked
if true:
Statement inside the loop executes, printing the current value of i
increment i by 1
if false:
Loop terminates and the program continues

iv) Repeat until i becomes 6, at which point the condition fails, and the  "loop has ended"
is printed

For loop in java
-for(initialization expression; test expression;update expression){
//body of the loop
//statements to execute
}

Working
-Control enters the loop
-Initialization is executed once  at the beginning of the loop
-The condition is evaluated
*If true control moves to Step 4
*If false, control jumps to step 7
-The body of the loop is executed
-Control moves to the update step
-After Update, the flow returns to the condition(Step 3) and repeats the process
-Once the condition becomes false, the control exits the for loop, the statements outside
the loop are executed

Java for loops is divided into various parts:
Initialization Expression:
-Initializes the loop variable. This is executed once at the start of the loop
int i = 0;

Test Expression
-Tests the loop condition. If true the loop body is executed, otherwise the loop terminates
i <= 10;

Update Expression
-After executing the loop body, this expression increments/decrements the loop variable by some
value
i++;

FOR LOOP TO PRINT STRING
-class Main{
   public static void main(String[]args){
       //write a for loop
       //to print "Hello World" five times
       for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
       System.out.println("Hello World");
       }
    }


Infinite Loop
-An infinite loop  occurs when the loop's condition never becomes false
Example
class Loop{
   public static void main(String[]args){
   i >= 1 is always true
      for(int i =  1; i >= 1; i++){
       System.out.println("Infinite loop " + i);
       }
   }
}

Advantage of a For loop
-This is ideal for iterating over a known range or collection
-Efficient syntax for initialization, condition checking and incrementing
-Easy to control the number of iterations
-Efficient for looping through arrays and collections
