Static Binding
=It is one which is resolved at compile time by the compiler
=Also Known as early binding
=The binding of all static,private and final methods is done at compile time

Dynamic Binding
=The compiler does not decide which method to be invoked
=Overriding is an example of dynamic binding since in overriding the Parent class and the child class
have the same method

Difference between Static binding and Dynamic Binding
Static Binding                                                 Dynamic Binding
I)It takes place at compile time                               It takes place at runtime so it is
for which is referred as early binding                         referred as late binding
II)It uses overloading more precisely                          It uses overriding methods
operator overloading method
III)Takes place using normal functions                         Takes place using virtual functions
IV)Static, const, private functions                            Real objects use dynamic binding
use real objects in static binding
